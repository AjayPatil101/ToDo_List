**TODO List App**
A simple, interactive TODO list web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to help users manage and organize tasks efficiently. This project leverages Bootstrap for styling and provides users with a clean and responsive interface.

**Features**
1 **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a title and description, which will be stored locally in the browser's localStorage.
2 **View Tasks**: All added tasks are displayed in a table format, showing the task's serial number, title, and description.
3 **Delete Tasks**: Each task has a delete button, allowing users to remove specific tasks from the list.
4 **Clear All Tasks**: Users can clear all tasks from the list with a single click, which removes the stored data from localStorage.
5 **Search Tasks**: A search bar allows users to filter tasks by title, making it easier to locate specific items in large lists.

**Technology Stack**
  1 HTML5: For the basic structure of the application.
  2 CSS (Bootstrap): Used to enhance the appearance and responsiveness of the application.
  3 JavaScript: Core functionality, including localStorage management and dynamic updates to the task list.
